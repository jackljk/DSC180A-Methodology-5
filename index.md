## Answer to Prompts

1. The most interesting topic that I have covered in the domain is 2 things. Firstly, I found learning about the climate science to be extremely interesting. The main thing that pique my interest was how a most people only think that global warming is only caused by C02, but as part of the domain we also learnt other gases that are emitted into our environment that also affect our climate namely aerosol gasses such as Black Carbon and Sulfur Dioxide. These were interesting to learn about and how they come about (i.e what emitts them) and where they are mostly emitted around the world as based of plots that we plot from the data that we were provided for this capstone domain project.\\
The next thing that I found interesting in my domain was learning about the Gaussian process, as part of the domain the 3 main Machine Learning/Deep Learning frameworks that we are using are a Convoluted Neural Network, Random Forest and a Gaussian Process. And of the 3 I had not learnt about the Gaussian Process before and it was interesting to learn about it and how it works and how it is different from the other 2 models that we are using. As I delve deeper into the Gaussian Process I learnt about how it is very different from other models as it also provides a confidence interval for the predictions that it makes, which is something that the other 2 models do not provide. Which along with the confidence interval it allows the model to give predictions that are correct or wrong as predictions that are not in the confidence interval can usually be ruled as incorrect predictions. This is something that I found interesting and I am looking forward to learning more about the Gaussian Process as I continue to work on this capstone project and go on to learn more about how to optimize it for the second part of the capstone project.
2. A potential investigation that I would like to do in part 2 of the project is 1 of 2 things or even maybe both if it is possible which is one to explore other potential Machine Learning Models, Deep Learning Frameworks or maybe even AI that could tackle the problem that my Professors ClimateBench model is doing and see if it is possible that there is another model/method along with the preprocessed data used in ClimateBench that could potentially do better or rival my professors models in terms of accuracy and performance. The other thing that I would like to explore is to see if there is a way to optimize the Gaussian Process model that we are using in terms of performance and accuracy. As I have learnt that the Gaussian Process model is very slow and takes a long time to train and make predictions and for the model we do not fully optimize it and we also do not train it completely so it would be interesting to see how I could maybe improve on it.
3. A change would be to make it more open ended in part 2 vs part 1, as part one was mainly for reproducing my professors work in order to see whether it was reproduceable and in order for us to gain a better understanding of his code and climate science domain as a whole as all of us came into the project with no prior climate knowledge.
4. I am interested in using models like XGBoost, SVM or even a different Deep Learning Framework like a Recurrent Neural Network or a Long Short Term Memory Network. I am also interested in exploring other AI models like a Genetic Algorithm or a Reinforcement Learning model (If it is possible I haven't really given it much thought on whether these are possible). I am also interested in exploring other ways to optimize the Gaussian Process model that we are using in terms of performance and accuracy.
